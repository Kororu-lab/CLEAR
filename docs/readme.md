## Executive Summary

CLEAR (Clustering and Stock Impact-based News Recommendation System) is an advanced news recommendation system based on NAVER's AiRs architecture, specifically adapted for financial news analysis and stock impact assessment. Unlike the original AiRs system which focuses on personalization, CLEAR prioritizes the impact of news on stock prices, providing recommendations that highlight financially significant news articles.

The system implements all core mechanisms from NAVER's AiRs (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Quality Estimation, Social Interest, and Latest news prioritization) while replacing personalization components with stock impact analysis. CLEAR processes Korean financial news articles, clusters related content, analyzes the impact on stock prices, and generates recommendations based on financial significance rather than personal preferences.

This technical report provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, implementation details, and evaluation results, demonstrating how CLEAR successfully adapts NAVER's proven news recommendation approach to the financial domain.

## Introduction

### Background

News recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users navigate the overwhelming volume of information published daily. NAVER, one of Korea's leading technology companies, developed the AiRs (AI Recommender system) to provide personalized news recommendations to its users. This system combines multiple recommendation approaches, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and social interest metrics.

While personalization is valuable for general news consumption, financial news requires a different approach. Investors and financial analysts are less concerned with personal preferences and more interested in how news affects stock prices and market movements. This creates a need for a recommendation system that prioritizes financial impact over personalization.

### Objectives

The CLEAR system aims to:

1. Adapt NAVER's AiRs architecture for financial news recommendation
2. Replace personalization components with stock impact analysis
3. Implement news clustering to group related financial articles
4. Develop a comprehensive pipeline from data collection to recommendation
5. Create an evaluation framework to assess system performance

### Scope

CLEAR focuses on Korean financial news, particularly articles related to specific stock tickers. The system processes news from Yonhap News Agency (YNA) and analyzes their impact on corresponding stock prices. While the original AiRs system includes extensive personalization features, CLEAR intentionally excludes these components, focusing instead on objective financial impact metrics.

## System Architecture

CLEAR follows a modular architecture inspired by NAVER's AiRs system, with components organized into four main layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - News Crawler: Collects financial news articles from YNA
   - Stock Data Collector: Retrieves stock price data from Yahoo Finance

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Text Preprocessor: Cleans and tokenizes Korean text
   - News Vectorizer: Converts articles into vector representations

3. **Core Algorithm Layer**
   - News Clustering: Groups related articles using hierarchical clustering
   - Stock Impact Analyzer: Measures news impact on stock prices
   - News Recommender: Generates recommendations based on multiple factors

4. **Application Layer**
   - Pipeline: Integrates all components into a cohesive workflow
   - Scheduler: Runs the pipeline at market open/close times
   - Evaluation: Assesses system performance

The architecture maintains the multi-factor recommendation approach from AiRs while replacing personalization with stock impact analysis. The system is designed to be configurable, with parameters adjustable through a central configuration file.

```

## Core Algorithms

### News Vectorization

The News Vectorizer converts preprocessed text into vector representations for clustering and similarity calculations. It implements multiple embedding methods with configurable parameters.

Key features:
- Multiple embedding methods (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, OpenAI)
- Configurable title/content weighting
- Dimensionality reduction for efficient clustering
- GPU acceleration for neural methods

Implementation details:
```python
class NewsVectorizer:
    def __init__(self, method='tfidf', max_features=10000, title_weight=2.0):
        self.method = method
        self.max_features = max_features
        self.title_weight = title_weight
        
    def vectorize_articles(self, articles_df, content_col='processed_content', 
                          title_col='processed_title', combine_title_content=True):
        # Implementation for article vectorization
        pass
```

The vectorization process follows these steps:
1. Preprocess text using the Text Preprocessor
2. Apply the selected embedding method (default: TF-IDF)
3. Combine title and content vectors with title weighting
4. Optionally reduce dimensions using SVD

### News Clustering

The News Clustering module groups related articles using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, following NAVER's approach. It uses cosine similarity to measure article relatedness and forms clusters based on a configurable distance threshold.

Key features:
- Hierarchical agglomerative clustering with cosine similarity
- Configurable distance threshold and cluster size limits
- Automatic cluster topic generation
- Support for updating clusters with new articles
- Trending cluster identification

Implementation details:
```python
class NewsClustering:
    def __init__(self, distance_threshold=0.7, min_cluster_size=3, max_cluster_size=20):
        self.distance_threshold = distance_threshold
        self.min_cluster_size = min_cluster_size
        self.max_cluster_size = max_cluster_size
        
    def cluster_articles(self, articles_df, vector_col='vector'):
        # Implementation for article clustering
        pass
        
    def get_trending_clusters(self, articles_df, timeframe_hours=24):
        # Implementation for identifying trending clusters
        pass
```

The clustering algorithm follows these steps:
1. Calculate pairwise cosine similarities between article vectors
2. Apply hierarchical agglomerative clustering with average linkage
3. Form clusters based on the distance threshold
4. Filter out small clusters below the minimum size
5. Split large clusters that exceed the maximum size
6. Generate topics for each valid cluster

### Stock Impact Analysis

The Stock Impact Analyzer measures the impact of news articles on stock prices, replacing the personalization components in NAVER's AiRs with financial impact metrics.

Key features:
- Multi-window impact analysis (immediate, short-term, medium-term)
- Impact score calculation on a -5 to +5 scale
- Machine learning models for impact prediction
- GPU-accelerated neural network option
- Visualization of news impact on stock prices

Implementation details:
```python
class StockImpactAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, time_windows=None, impact_thresholds=None, use_gpu=True):
        self.time_windows = time_windows or [
            {"name": "immediate", "hours": 1},
            {"name": "short_term", "hours": 24},
            {"name": "medium_term", "days": 3}
        ]
        self.impact_thresholds = impact_thresholds or {
            "high": 0.02,    # 2% price change
            "medium": 0.01,  # 1% price change
            "low": 0.005     # 0.5% price change
        }
        self.use_gpu = use_gpu
        
    def analyze_news_impact(self, news_df, stock_data):
        # Implementation for impact analysis
        pass
        
    def train_impact_model(self, news_df, stock_data, model_type='random_forest'):
        # Implementation for training impact prediction model
        pass
```

The impact analysis process follows these steps:
1. For each news article, identify mentioned stock tickers
2. For each time window, calculate price and volume changes after article publication
3. Calculate impact scores based on configurable thresholds
4. Aggregate impacts across multiple tickers if needed
5. Calculate overall impact as a weighted average across time windows

### News Recommendation

The News Recommender generates recommendations based on multiple factors, adapting NAVER's AiRs approach to focus on stock impact rather than personalization.

Key features:
- Multi-factor recommendation scoring
- Stock impact prioritization
- Cluster-based recommendations
- Trending topic identification
- Configurable factor weights

Implementation details:
```python
class NewsRecommender:
    def __init__(self, weights=None):
        self.weights = weights or {
            'impact': 0.4,      # Stock Impact (SI) - replaces Social Interest in AiRS
            'quality': 0.2,     # Quality Estimation (QE)
            'content': 0.2,     # Content-Based Filtering (CBF)
            'collaborative': 0.1, # Collaborative Filtering (CF)
            'recency': 0.1      # Latest news prioritization
        }
        
    def recommend_articles(self, articles_df, top_n=10):
        # Implementation for article recommendations
        pass
        
    def recommend_clusters(self, articles_df, top_n=5, articles_per_cluster=3):
        # Implementation for cluster recommendations
        pass
```

The recommendation algorithm calculates scores based on five factors:
1. **Stock Impact (SI)**: Replaces Social Interest in AiRs, prioritizing articles with significant financial impact
2. **Quality Estimation (QE)**: Uses cluster size and other metrics as proxies for article quality
3. **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)**: Measures similarity to popular financial articles
4. **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Uses NPMI (Normalized Point-wise Mutual Information) for article relationships
5. **Latest**: Prioritizes recent articles to ensure timely recommendations
